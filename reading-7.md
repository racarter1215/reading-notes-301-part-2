# Employee Performance Optimization

### The process of analyzing and improving individual workers

##### The time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities has ballooned by 50 percent or more

##### Over the last two decades and that, at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues

##### Studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems. So software development is now a team sport

##### It’s better to put introverts together in teams, apparently.

### Project Aristotle

##### It was a review of a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked.

##### it was almost impossible to find patterns or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference.

##### Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.

##### Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google’s teams.

##### After experimentation, they found that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others.

##### Researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.

##### Good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’, meaning that they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.

##### Psychological Safety is a shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.

##### Also a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up.

##### Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a ‘‘work face’’ when they get to the office.

##### To feel ‘‘psychologically safe,’’ we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations.
